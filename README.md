A GUI tool that periodically checks file hashes of a specified folder to monitor data integrity 

Finished but not polished
1.) Slightly messy code.

2.) Need to learn asynchronous programming.

3.) Can't add folder containing more than 3GB because of synchronous approach to file operations.

4.) Do robust naming

> Will come back to redo this all over again at a later date. 4th time's a charm.
